# What is Still Alive: Aperture Uncut?
Still Alive: Aperture Uncut is a Portal project that aims to recreate and enhance the state of Portal 2's Beta in mid 2009 as based on screenshots and art concepts, including the early testing track, cut chambers, "destroyed" portal 1 testing track, and many more concepts created by our Writers and Artists to stay faithful to "Core-Hub" era while also providing our own vision for how the game would have felt if it released in 2022
